# Version Chooser

Use the variant that matches your host. When in doubt: **bazzite** for Steam Deck/Bazzite; **main** for everything else; **mac** if you want mac-specific notes.

- **bazzite** — Steam Deck / HTPC running Bazzite. Tweaks for Deck UI, Proton/SteamOS paths, GPU/power defaults.  
  [Open bazzite docs](/versions/bazzite/)
- **mac** — macOS-specific notes (Homebrew paths, mac OneDrive detection, TouchID/1Password). Base is the same as main with mac callouts.  
  [Open mac docs](/versions/mac/)
- **main** — Generic macOS + Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora/Arch/WSL) without Bazzite-specific defaults.  
  _(Public page pending; use main branch in the repo for now.)_

You can switch anytime via the navbar “Version” dropdown.
